# Debounced Search with Highlighting | Vanilla JavaScript

This project demonstrates how to implement a search feature with debouncing and text highlighting using JavaScript. The search functionality is designed to handle user input efficiently, with results updated in real-time while highlighting the search terms.

Debouncing is a programming technique used to limit how often a function is executed. Itâ€™s particularly useful when handling events that fire repeatedly in quick succession, such as user typing in a search input or scrolling through a page. By implementing debounce, you can delay the execution of a function until a specified period of inactivity has passed, reducing the frequency of function calls and improving performance.

## Features

- **Debounced Search**: Reduces the number of function calls during user input to improve performance.
- **Real-time Search Filtering**: Filters and displays search results as the user types.
- **Text Highlighting**: Highlights matching search terms in the displayed results.
